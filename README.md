## üñãÔ∏è Naming convention
There will be lots of tweaked copies of the same artwork in each folder. Let's use some examples to explain the naming convention:

```
- Mantis f1 l1.svg
- Mantis f1 l2.svg
- Mantis f2 l1.svg
- Mantis f2 l2.svg
```

You will notice the labels `f1`, `f2`, `l1`, `l2`. These are not random...

- **fx = Image Size Factor. Describes the whole image size.**

f1 means *factor of 1*, which is the image's default size. f2 means *factor of 2*, meaning the image is half the size of the default image. f16 would be 1/16th the size of the default image. The higher x is, the smaller the image is.


- **lx = Line Thickness Factor. Describes the line thickness.**

l1 means the lines are a thickness factor of 1 (the default line thickness). l2 means the lines are a thickness factor of 2. l2 images have thinner lines (proportionally) than l1 images, l4 images have thinner lines than l2 images. The higher x is, the thinner the line is.

`Image Name f1 l1` is the default image. All naming conventions are based on this image.


Finally, the `Colored` keyword specifies whether the image is colored or not. 

## üç¶ Commissions

If you have an image you would like me to commission in this Ocean-inspired art style (or in general), please DM me on Discord at **Sarah (DataUnion.app)#0037**. We can discuss. üòä

## üßú Tweaking requests 

If you like my pictures but they don't fit your precise needs, you can make a tweaking request. Tweaking requests are different to commissions as they are less major. Things I can tweak are:

- Colors of lines and dots
- Overall size of the image
- Thickness of lines 
- Size of dots

Things I CANNOT tweak are:

- Colors of triangles.
- Overall shape of the image.
- Animations

If you want any of these last things added / tweaked, you need to file a commission instead.

Please **open an Issue** or DM me on Discord at **Sarah (DataUnion.app)#0037** with your tweaking request. Your request doesn't have to follow the naming convention but it helps if it does.
